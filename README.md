# Rep for made final project. 
The rep consisit of implementations of two models:   
1. Pointer Generator https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04368  
2. Extraction model from Bottom Up (simplified a bit) https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10792   

Also, there is gradio demonstration of these models. To run it >> docker comopse up. There is a third model included in demonstration. This model is transformers based model - https://huggingface.co/IlyaGusev/mbart_ru_sum_gazeta.

All models trained on russian news corpus https://huggingface.co/datasets/IlyaGusev/gazeta.  
Trainings process histories for pointer and bottom up models are in juptyter notebooks.  
Final Metrics notebook is also included.
